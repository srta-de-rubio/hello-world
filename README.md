# hello-world
Hi everyone!
Mi name is Ksenia. I´m working towards changing my career from the tourism industry to Data Science (quite a change, isn´t it?). Here I´m planning to publish my study projects completed as part of the Dataquest.io course and then I´ll practice doing projects with some Kaggle datasets of my interest.
